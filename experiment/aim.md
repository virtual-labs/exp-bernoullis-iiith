Most of the hydraulics studies are based on the principle of Bernoulli's theorem. Verification of above principle experimentally helps in better understanding of the principles of hydraulics flow. The theorem is based on the law of conservation of energy. According to the Bernoulli's theorem in an ideal incompressible steady and continues flow, the sum of the pressure energy ,potential energy, and the kinematic energy per unit weight of the fluid is constant. 

Therfore the aim of the experiment will be to verify Bernoulli's theorem.
