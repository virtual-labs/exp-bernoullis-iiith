**Constants**
- Measuring tank size, a m2. 
- The height (hm) for which the time t1 and t2 are noted to collect water in the measuring tank.
- The areas of cross section A1, A2, etc.

**Variables** 

- The piezometer readings HP1, HP2 etc in m of water. 
- Time tm seconds requried to collect water for a height of hm in the measuring tank as mean value of readings t1 and t2.
